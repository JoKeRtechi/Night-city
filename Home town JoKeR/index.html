                <h2>The Interstate</h2>
                <h3>The highway featured in Cyberpunk 2077 has its own way of showcasing the beauty of the world. By
                    connecting it all together, players should take a car (preferably a rather fast one), which will
                    allow them to drive at top speed and jump around from location to location. What makes the
                    interstate so appealing is that it puts players on a path that may reward them in the end by giving
                    them an item or a mission. Since players will spend a lot of time driving on it, taking in the
                    sights will come automatically.</h3>
            </div>
            <div class="charter">
                <h2>Charter Hill Skyway</h2>
                <h3>Most players will miss this spot unless they search for it. Located in the middle of Charter Hill,
                    this skyway looks to be unapproachable at first, but players who search for a way up will be
                    rewarded with one of the best locations for vistas. The skyway itself is quite high up, so players
                    will be able to take in a lot of not just Charter Hill, but the expanding skyline surrounding them.
                    The best part is that it's neatly tucked away; the population density in the area is quite low,
                    which means players will find it more peaceful than most other locations.</h3>
            </div>
            <div class="jig">
                <h2>Jig Jig Street</h2>
                <h3>This area in Night City is probably one of the best to show off the best of what Cyberpunk 2077 has
                    to offer, with the neon lights and heavily packed areas. Players can witness the fine details of the
                    game, like how NPCs interact with one another, and the signs to the shops give off the exact energy
                    Cyberpunk 2077 is conveying. It's not just good for sights, either. Jig Jig Street is home to some
                    interesting side quests with high rewards, so players should go there as much as they can.</h3>
