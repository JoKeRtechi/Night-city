# Night-city

My first basic html/css project which I though I should publish on github so, I did and if you wanna edit it then do as you wish and make it more beautiful then me cause I'm just a beginner.

Disclaimer: I didn't had any plan on what I was gonna build at first and as this is just random without any visions in mind so it might be not good as you think but as a begginer for me it turnes out really  great.
